F30 is a 531 workout program calculator personalized for myself. This calculates the working weights for the four main lifts
in one 4-week cycle while also displaying the accessory exercises and the amount of [sets]x[reps]. Personalization can easily
be done by editing string.xml and replacing strings in corresponding places for other users
